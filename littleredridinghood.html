           <div class="text1">Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.</div>

            <img class="red2" src="/image/red2.jpg" alt="secondImage">
            <div class="text2">One day her mother said to her, "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before you do it."</div>

            <div class="text3">The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.</div>

            <div class="text4">"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood" said he.

                <p></p>

                "Thank you kindly, wolf." Said the girl.

                <p></p>
                
                "Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"

                <p></p>
                
                "To my grandmother's."

                <p></p>
                
                "What have you got in your apron?"

                <p></p>
                
                "Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."

                <p></p>
                
                "Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"

                <p></p>
                
                "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it," replied Little Red Riding Hood.

                <p></p>
                
                The wolf thought to himself, "What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both." So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, "see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry."</div>

        <div>
            <img class="red5" src="/image/red5.jpg" alt="fifthImage">
            <div class="text5">Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.</div>
